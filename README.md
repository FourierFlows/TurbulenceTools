# TurbulenceTools

This package provides code and tools for solving problems in geophysical turbulence. Right now it addresses two-dimensional turbulence. In the future it might include quasi-geostrophic turbulence, stratified turbulence, and more.

This package is not yet an official Julia package. For now, the package is used by typing

```
julia> Pkg.add("https://github.com/FourierFlows/TurbulenceTools")
```

at the Julia REPL. Make sure to run `Pkg.checkout("TurbulenceTools")` often to keep up with rapid changes to the package.
